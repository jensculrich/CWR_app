### Find native CWR

In this section you can identify native and naturalized CWR and WUS in Canadian. Clicking on an ecoregion will generate a list of locally occurring CWR and WUS plants. Note especially the conservation threat assessments: Conservation status in Canada ranges between Secure (N5), Apparently Secure (N4), Vulnerable (N3), Imperiled (N2) and Critically Imperilled (N1); [COSEWIC Assessments](https://www.cosewic.ca/index.php/en-ca/) are rated from moderate concern (Special Concern (SC) / Préoccupante (P)) to highest concern (Threatened (T) / Mecée (M); and Endangered (E) / En voie de disparition (VD)). Note, taxa without a COSEWIC status may still be vulnerable but have not yet received a national assessment.
