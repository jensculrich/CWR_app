### Find native CWR by province or biogeographic ecoregion

In this section you can identify native and naturalized* CWR and WUS in Canada. Clicking on a province or ecoregion will generate a list of locally occurring CWR and WUS plants. Note especially the conservation threat assessments: [Conservation status](https://www.natureserve.org/canada) in Canada ranges between Secure (N5), Apparently Secure (N4), Vulnerable (N3), Imperiled (N2) and Critically Imperilled (N1); [COSEWIC Assessments](https://www.cosewic.ca/index.php/en-ca/) are rated from moderate concern (Special Concern (SC) / Préoccupante (P)) to highest concern (Threatened (T) / Mecée (M); and Endangered (E) / En voie de disparition (VD)).  Taxa without a COSEWIC status may still be vulnerable but have not yet received a national assessment.
Categories are used to describe potential utility in breeding programs: 1A (progenitor or is the crop itself, immediate relative, or used as graftstock; highest utility), 1B (secondary relative), 1C (distant relative or unknown genetic proximity to the crop species; lower utility), 2 (CWR of non-food crop plants, e.g. forage crops, forest resources, medicinals, and ornamental plants). Categories are not assigned for WUS.

*Naturalized plants are those that are introduced to Canada and are now well-established with persistent populations.
