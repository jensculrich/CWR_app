# About
This web app was designed and created in 2021/2022 by Jens Ulrich & Erika Luna Perez, and accompanies the paper ["Towards and integrative strategy for conservation of crop wild relatives (CWR) and wild-utilized plants (WUS) in Canada"](); which is co-authored by Jens Ulrich (University of British Columbia), Erika Luna Perez (University of British Columbia), Kephra Beckett (University of British Columbia), Lili Simon (University of British Columbia), Zoë Migicovsky (Dalhousie University), Tara Moreau (University of British Columbia Botanical Garden), Axel Diederichsen (Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada - Plant Gene Resources Canada) and Colin Khoury (San Diego Botanic Garden, International Center for Tropical Agriculture (CIAT)).

# Land Acknowledgment

We acknowledge that this work has been conducted on the ancestral and unceded lands of all the Indigenous Peoples (Inuit, Métis, and First Nations) who steward Canada’s biodiversity, including the diversity of CWR and WUS in that may be explored through this web application. 

### CWR and WUS collection data was contributed by: 
7 botanical gardens from across Canada - Montreal Botanic Garden (Montreal, QC), the University of Guelph Arboretum (Guelph, ON), the Royal Botanical Gardens (Burlington, ON), Mount Pleasant Cemetery Gardens (Toronto, ON), University of British Columbia Botanical Garden (Vancouver, BC), VanDusen Botanical Garden (Vancouver, BC) and Reader Rock Garden (Calgary, AB).

Collections data from genebanks was gathered directly through publicly available databases: 
* [PGRC Canada](https://pgrc-rpc.agr.gc.ca/gringlobal/landing)
* [National Tree Seed Centre - Canada](https://www.nrcan.gc.ca/science-and-data/research-centres-and-labs/forestry-research-centres/atlantic-forestry-centre/national-tree-seed-centre/13449)
