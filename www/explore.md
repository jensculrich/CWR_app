### Explore CWR

This section allows you to explore the conservation status of native and naturalized Canadian CWR and WUS in <i> ex situ </i> conservation systems. Begin by selecting a CWR or WUS of interest. The resulting map shows the occurrence range of the selected CWR or WUS in Canada, including regions that are represented (dark grey) by one or more collections from Canadian wild populations that are currently protected in ex situ conservation systems. Circle points indicate the geographic origin of CWR and WUS accessions that were collected from wild-populations in Canada and currently held in botanical gardens (BG - yellow) or national genebanks (G - magenta).

Ex situ collections considered here are a meta-collection assembled from national genebanks (G) (Plant Genetic Resources Canada, National Tree Seed Centre - Canada, University of Saskatchewan Prairie Fruit Genebank - Canada, and the United States Dept. of Agriculture Nationa Germplasm System - United States) as well as from 7 major Canadian botanical gardens (BG).

This meta-collection was assembled in 2021.
