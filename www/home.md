<i> Conservation of Crop Wild Relatives (CWR) and Wild-utilized Plants (WUS) in Canada </i> is an app tool that will enable you to explore the diversity of CWR and WUS in Canada. 

Learn more about CWR and WUS on the "What are CWR?" tab. Explore diversity on the "Find Native CWR" and "CWR Conservation" tabs

This tool was designed to accompany [a national inventory and conservation assessment of Canada's CWR and WUS diversity](https://doi.org/10.1002/csc2.20807)

You can access our inventory of Canadian CWR and WUS 
[here](https://github.com/jensculrich/Canadian_CWR_inventory_and_conservation/blob/main/Input_Data_and_Files/inventory.csv).

This app was made with [RShiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/), with underlying construction code stored on [github](https://github.com/jensculrich/CWR_app), and can alternatively be downloaded and run using a local computer as a server (if a recent version of R statistical software is installed).
